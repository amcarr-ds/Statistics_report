Final Project for ADS-500A: Statistics &amp; Probability for Data Science

Abstract:
An examination of sample statistics and development of a linear regression model were utilized to determine whether key vehicle features (e.g., such as petroleum use, engine cylinder count, luggage volume) could predict outcomes for CO2 emissions. The objective of this project is to provide San Diego government agency decision-makers with evidence that could be used for regulation and changes in infrastructure planning. Sample data on vehicle characteristics such as petroleum use, mechanical design, and recorded CO2 output was collected from www.fueleconomy.gov in order to perform analyses on secondary data. After initial steps reviewing statistical measures, including consideration of associations and correlations between key variables of interest, a linear regression model was created that had nine regression coefficients. However, due to apparent issues of multicollinearity among predictor variables and a potential error introduced by categorical variables, both of which were discovered during the initial multivariate analyses, a revised regression model was developed that relies on three regression coefficients. Though the coefficient of determination on the trimmed model was lower (𝑅𝑅2 = .8792) than in the original model (𝑅𝑅2 = .9814), this was found acceptable in an attempt to mitigate overfitting of future data. The final model provided sufficient evidence, based on a 95% confidence interval (all p-values for the final model < .001), that an effective model could be developed to predict CO2 based on relatively few key standard vehicle features.
